# smartGlove
In the world of more than 7 billion people, there are many who aren’t as privileged as ourselves. Many face one or multiple disabilities even in their day-to-day lives. Among them, one of the most common “disabilities” is muteness. Mute people often have a hard time communicating with others at the speed of thought. So, to tackle this problem, we have come up with a smart communicating glove, whereby, they would practically be able to not only communicate with ease, but also will be faster, than traditional methods. Our smart glove uses gestures constructed by finger movements, to string characters to form words and sentences for ease of communication. We also have integrated text to speech conversion for general ease of use, or if the user has any visual impairments.
